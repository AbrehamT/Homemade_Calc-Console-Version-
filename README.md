# Homemade_Calc-Console-Version-
Calculator that can only perform basic arithmetic calculations. This is a console based program and therefore has no GUI functionalities.
Similar to the GUI version for this calculator I am researching Numerical Methods, in conjunction with a UNLV faculty member, to add integral and derivative functionalities.
